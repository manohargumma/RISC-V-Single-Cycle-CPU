## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository implements a **32-bit single-cycle RISC-V CPU** capable of executing a subset of **RV32I instructions**, including:

* **R-Type:** `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `SLT`
* **I-Type:** `ADDI`, `LW`
* **S-Type:** `SW`
* **B-Type:** `BEQ`

The CPU is designed for **educational purposes** and can be easily extended to support more instructions or pipelining.

**Key Features:**

* Single-cycle execution (all operations complete in one clock cycle)
* Word-addressed **instruction and data memory**
* 32 general-purpose registers with **x0 hardwired to zero**
* Full **ALU and Control Unit implementation**
* Supports **immediate generation**, branch calculation, and memory access

##  Instruction Examples

The instruction memory is preloaded with a **simple ALU program**:

| Addr | Instruction    | Description                |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0x00 | `addi x0,x0,0` | NOP                        |
| 0x04 | `addi x1,x0,5` | x1 = 5                     |
| 0x08 | `addi x2,x0,3` | x2 = 3                     |
| 0x0C | `add x3,x1,x2` | x3 = x1 + x2               |
| 0x10 | `sw x3,0(x0)`  | Store x3 in data memory[0] |
| 0x14 | `lw x4,0(x0)`  | Load memory[0] into x4     |

**Expected CPU Behavior:**

* x1 = 5
* x2 = 3
* x3 = 8
* Memory[0] = 8
* x4 = 8

##  CPU Datapath Overview

The CPU has a **single-cycle datapath**, where all instruction types are executed in **one clock cycle**:

1. **Fetch:** Read instruction from `Instruction_Memory` using PC
2. **Decode:** Parse instruction fields, read registers, generate control signals
3. **Execute:** ALU performs arithmetic/logic or calculates memory/branch addresses
4. **Memory:** Read/write data memory for `LW`/`SW`
5. **Write-Back:** Update register file with ALU or memory result

**Branching:** `BEQ` instruction uses a **branch adder** and PC mux to select next PC.

##  Simulation

**Waveform generation** using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave:

```bash
iverilog -o cpu_tb riscv_single_file.v
vvp cpu_tb
gtkwave dump.vcd
```

Check:

* PC increments by 4
* Register writes occur correctly
* Data memory updates as expected
* ALU operations match instruction semantics

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/riscv_single_cycle_cpu.git
cd riscv_single_cycle_cpu
```

2. Compile and simulate:

```bash
iverilog -o cpu_tb riscv_single_file.v
vvp cpu_tb
gtkwave dump.vcd
```

3. Observe register and memory behavior in the waveform viewer.

Do you want me to create that diagram and attach it for the README?
